    <div class="stb">Free Fire‚Äôs Inventionc </div>
    <p>Timeline of Free Fire‚Äôs Invention and Growth:<br>
        <br>2017:
        Free Fire was officially released on December 4, 2017, for Android and iOS. It was created to offer a lightweight battle royale experience optimized for lower-end smartphones.<br>
        
        <br>Developer:<br>
        The game was developed by 111dots Studio, but the publishing and global success came from Garena, which provided the marketing, servers, and updates to bring it to a wide audience.<br>
        
        <br> Inspiration:<br>
        Free Fire was inspired by the massive popularity of battle royale games like PUBG. It focused on creating a fast-paced, mobile-friendly version that could run on most smartphones.<br>
        
        <br> Core Gameplay:<br>
        
        50 players are dropped onto an island.
        
        They fight to be the last one standing.
        
        Matches last about 10 minutes, shorter than many other battle royale games.
        
        The shrinking "safe zone" mechanic pushes players closer together over time.
        
        Success:
        
        By 2019, Free Fire became one of the most downloaded mobile games globally.
        
        It has especially large followings in India, Brazil, Indonesia, and Southeast Asia.
        
        It even won the award for "Best Popular Vote Game" by Google Play Store in 2019.</p>
